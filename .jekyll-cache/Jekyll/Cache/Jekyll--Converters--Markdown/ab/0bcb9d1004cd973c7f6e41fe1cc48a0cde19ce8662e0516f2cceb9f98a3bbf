I"Â<p>As you may or may not know, I‚Äôm an avid <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/jwhamilton_/collection">vinyl</a> collector. As of writing, I have 290 records in my collection. Some may see it as an addiction, but I see it as‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say a very <em>passionate</em> hobby.</p>

<p>That being said, there are many albums I‚Äôve spent months, even years trying to find for a reasonable price (I‚Äôm not about to drop $500 for a no-box copy of Drukqs). I spend a lot of time looking at different vinyl dealers, trying to find good deals on albums from artists I like. Sometimes, I get lucky; other times, not so much. So, in no particular order, here‚Äôs six of my favorite albums I‚Äôve gotten my hands on this year.</p>

<h2 id="nine-inch-nails---the-fragile">Nine Inch Nails - The Fragile</h2>

<p>When I say I spend months tracking down records, I‚Äôm not lying. By the time I decided to buy The Fragile, it had already been (to my knowledge) out of press for a few months. It‚Äôs still sold out everywhere, and scalpers are <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/10694620">taking advantage of that</a>. However, one day I just happened to look at the Barnes and Noble site and saw that a store nearby had <em>one</em> copy of it that they had just gotten in. So I immediately called and reserved it, and soon after it was mine for $10 less than MSRP.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Tracks: Somewhat Damaged, Just Like You Imagined, La Mer, The Great Below</em></p>

<h2 id="the-national---high-violet">The National - High Violet</h2>

<p>This is another case where I was searching for a few weeks and ended up finding it at that same Barnes and Noble. Then a few weeks later when I went back to school, I went to another local record store and found out they and were selling a copy for $10 less than I paid for it. Ah well, such is life.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Tracks: Little Faith, Afraid of Everyone, Bloodbuzz Ohio, Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks</em></p>

<h2 id="bonobo---migration">Bonobo - Migration</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/11/24/migration.jpeg" alt="Bonobo - Migration" /></p>

<p>Ever since I discovered this album in 2017, it has been one of my favorite albums ever. So of course, when I saw that one of my local record stores got a copy in stock, I had to have it. Problem was: the semester had just ended and I had to leave campus, so I missed it the first time. However, almost 6 months later (when I was back on campus), they got another single copy in, which I reserved and picked up a few days later. It‚Äôs now one of my favorites, and they‚Äôre selling another copy for $5 more than I paid.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Tracks: Migration, Second Sun, Bambro Koyo Ganda, Figures</em></p>

<h2 id="nine-inch-nails---the-downward-spiral">Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/11/24/thedownwardspiral.jpeg" alt="Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral" /></p>

<p>This one had a similar situation to Migration, where I missed the first copy and got the next one a few months later. Nothing too impressive here, I‚Äôm just really happy I own it.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Tracks: March of the Pigs, Closer, Ruiner, Reptile</em></p>

<h2 id="halsey---if-i-cant-have-love-i-want-power">Halsey - If I Can‚Äôt Have Love, I Want Power</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/11/24/iichliwp.jpeg" alt="Halsey - If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power" /></p>

<p>I kinda slept on this album when it first came out, even though Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are two of my favorite artists. I finally gave it a listen a few weeks after it was released, and immediately fell in love. So I went to my local record store and they had only one copy left (buried in the ‚ÄúRock H‚Äù section no less), so it was meant to be. Now it‚Äôs one of the albums I play the most.</p>

<p><em>Favorite Tracks: Bells in Santa Fe, Easier than Lying, 1121, Ya‚Äôaburnee</em></p>

<h2 id="squarepusher---feed-me-weird-things">Squarepusher - Feed Me Weird Things</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/2021/11/24/fmwt.jpeg" alt="Squarepusher - Feed Me Weird Things" /></p>

<p>This one had some weird circumstances around it. I was talking to some friends and mentioned in passing that I really wanted this on vinyl, not aware that it had just been reissued for its 25th anniversary. I was informed of this, and immediately pre-ordered, super excited to experience the remastered tracks firsthand. However, the pre-order delivery date came and went with no word from the distributer. I waited another day or so, then emailed when there were still no updates. It eventually arrived almost a month after the promised delivery date. They were very apologetic and I‚Äôm really glad it came in the end, but I probably won‚Äôt order from them again anytime soon.</p>
