I"£<p>Today, I released a new app called Affirmations. It‚Äôs a self-care tool I made that delivers compliments and positive reminders to you. I specifically designed the foundation of the app in a way that I can add or remove affirmations as I please, arrange them into groups that the user can enable or disable, and make them time sensitive (i.e. for holidays). Kinda like <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/">CARROT</a>, but not homicidal.</p>

<p>A year ago, shit was bleak. The election was in full swing, COVID was unleashing a full-on rampage, there was just‚Ä¶ a <em>lot</em> happening. I thought ‚ÄúWell, what if there was a widget that could remind you that things are ok?‚Äù So I made it. I had a widget running with a few placeholder bits of text, and then expanded the text to be customizable server-side. Then I expanded the in-app interface. Added notifications. Breathing exercises. And then it was a full-fledged experience. One of the very last things I added was a list of global mental health resources, which I spent days compiling and sorting. It‚Äôs so much more than I thought it would be, and I‚Äôm so happy with how it came out.</p>

<p>Despite the nature of the app, being this feel-good self-care tool, I think I faced some of my biggest challenges as a developer while creating Affirmations. I was lucky enough to catch the attention of some high-profile people who signed on as beta testers, in addition to the 90 or so other testers at the time of writing who gave great feedback. However, by making an app like this, you assume a certain responsibility from your users. A responsibility to make a wholesome experience. A responsibility to make people happy. To help drive away sadness in the most frictionless way possible. Ok, I‚Äôm being a little facetious with that last point, but the sentiment stands. I have four other apps, and none of them have this much riding on them.</p>

<p>As someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, any project I undertake obviously needs to be up to the highest standards and have no flaws whatsoever, or they‚Äôre trash and not good enough and invalidate my entire career. Or that‚Äôs what happens in my head at least. Every time I opened Xcode, I face those feelings head on. I shove those feelings down, and I just do the work. And in the end, it may not be perfect, but it works. This is why the project has taken an entire year. No, seriously: I started the project on September 30th of 2020, and launched on September 30th of 2021.</p>

<p>This is amplified even more by the fact that I still feel like this was all a fluke. That the App Store editors featured Femto on the Discover page. That the MacStories team promoted Femto and Dot in any way. That Menu Bar Splitter gained the popularity it has. That I‚Äôve had over 3,000 downloads of all my apps over the past 2 years. I know those feelings will never go away, and I‚Äôll have to learn to live with them. But with a project like this, they really do start to sting.</p>

<p>However, I‚Äôm terrified. What if it breaks? What if there‚Äôs a fatal error on startup and no one can use it? What if a reviewer gets their hands on it and it‚Äôs essentially a digital paperweight? The past year of my life has culminated in this moment, and it could be invalidated with a single wrong line of code. I‚Äôve tested every section of Affirmations multiple times, yet I still have this nagging thought in the back of my head. I want to make people happy, and I want Affirmations to live up to the hype. I can think of a million different things I could have improved for version 1.0, but I‚Äôm swallowing that fear and letting it exist in its current, fantastic, v1.0 complete form.</p>

<p>In the past few months, I have received numerous stories of how Affirmations has made people happy. Even just once. These anecdotes make me remember that it is, in fact, good, and that I made the right choice in persisting through the doubt. By giving a big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to my impostor syndrome.</p>

<p>These are feelings that anyone who has worked on a project for this long has when releasing it to the public, right? So please, enjoy Affirmations. As narcissistic as it may sound, I‚Äôm so fucking proud of myself for creating it. There are times I‚Äôve considered scrapping the project, and questioned my entire iOS development career. However, I‚Äôm glad that I, as a developer, and Affirmations, are here today.</p>

<p>Affirmations is free. <a href="">Give it a shot, won‚Äôt you?</a></p>
