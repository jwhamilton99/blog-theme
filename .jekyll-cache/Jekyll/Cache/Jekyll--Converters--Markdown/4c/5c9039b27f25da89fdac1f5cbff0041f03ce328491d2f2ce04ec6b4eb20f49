I"U<p>Alright, so I’m realizing that updating posts later doesn’t work. I use <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> as my RSS reader, and it doesn’t refresh with the updated section. I can’t say if this exists for other readers, but you can never be too safe. I’ll stop doing updates on posts in the future.</p>
