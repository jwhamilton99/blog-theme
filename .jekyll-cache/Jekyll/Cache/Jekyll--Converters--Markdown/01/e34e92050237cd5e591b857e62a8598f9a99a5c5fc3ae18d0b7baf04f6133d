I"Å<p>So here we are, at the end of 2021. I always get a little sentimental around the new year, and since I now have an outlet for whatever the hell happens in my brain I figured I‚Äôd have a look back at the past year (and a look forward at the coming year while I‚Äôm at it).</p>

<h2 id="part-1-progress">Part 1: Progress</h2>

<p>I was drawn to the idea of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">Yearly Theme</a> since I learned about it from <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/">Cortex</a>. I‚Äôve tried year after year to stick to a set of resolutions, but I‚Äôd always fail relatively quickly. So I spent a year or two trying to make a Yearly Theme fit in my life, but I feel that this year was the first time that it actually felt <em>right</em>. At the turn of 2021, we were in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the year prior had been‚Ä¶ <em>something</em>, to say the least. In light of this, I wanted to go into 2021 with an optimistic view.</p>

<p>I knew that this was going to be a big year for me, specifically as I was set to graduate from college in 2021, so I designated this year as the <strong>Year of Progress</strong>. I wanted to make both personal and professional progress to help solidify things as I stepped into the post-grad chapter of my life. Now, as a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree, I confidently say that I have emerged on the positive side of progress.</p>

<p>In the past year, the two most important things I accomplished are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Graduate college (with two Dean‚Äôs List semesters in a row), and</li>
  <li>Launch Affirmations, my most successful app yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, the pessimist in me wants to say ‚Äúbut Justin, you dumb-dumb, that‚Äôs only 2 things. That‚Äôs not impressive.‚Äù And I would like to just indulge myself and say that these are two of the most intensive things I‚Äôve ever done, and I am so goddamn proud of myself. I have never felt more optimistic about the future, which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say. I can confidently say that I have made a name for myself now, and there are people who know who I am solely from Affirmations. This has already opened up some opportunities that I will further explore in 2022.</p>

<p>So in terms of setting myself up for my post-grad life, I think I have sufficiently achieved that.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-stability">Part 2: Stability</h2>

<p>If 2021 was mixing the concrete, my plan for 2022 is to lay the foundation. A lot of things are currently in flux, and I‚Äôd like to spend this year working on getting my life in order. You know, standard post-grad stuff like getting a job and becoming a full-fledged adult. I guess another part of this theme will be figuring out what that entails.</p>

<p>So I‚Äôm officially designating 2022 as the <strong>Year of Stability</strong>. I can‚Äôt really speak on how this will go, but I‚Äôm optimistic. In addition to having leads on jobs, not having to worry about classes anymore means I can spend the majority of my time on my apps. I understand that I‚Äôve been neglecting them, and now is the time to fall into a more regular development schedule.</p>

<p>So here are the things I want to work toward in 2022:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a full-time software development job,</li>
  <li>Get into a regular development schedule, and</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of uncertainties about my future.</li>
</ol>

<p>(That last point is very vague, but that‚Äôs kind of the point.)</p>

<p>An added benefit of this theme is that I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKOONaDRt10">fantastic Death Cab for Cutie song</a> to go along with it. I‚Äôd like to point out the first few lyrics of this song:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Time for the final bout,
Rows of deserted houses,
All our stable mates are highway bound.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I feel these also suit the theme really well. The feeling of moving on from a period of comfort and constants to embark on new adventures, as I plan to this year, comes through in them.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs my theme for 2022, I‚Äôll check in about this time next year. See you then.</p>
