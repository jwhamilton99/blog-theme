I"<<p>This past Christmas, I was gifted a <a href="https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977826389">10oz Ember Smart Mug</a> by my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/_brianhamilton">wonderful brother</a>. After running out of apple cider to drink late at night, I turned to my other favorite hot drink: hot chocolate. After seeing that the recipe on the back of the Hershey’s Cocoa Powder package would make <em>waaaay</em> too much for my needs, I scaled the recipe down to perfectly fit a 10oz mug like the Ember. You’re gonna need a scale for this.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.25oz granulated sugar</li>
  <li>0.5oz cocoa powder</li>
  <li>0.75oz water</li>
  <li>A pinch of kosher salt</li>
  <li>7.5oz milk (I just use 2%, you could probably use a dairy-free substitute here)</li>
  <li>A few drops of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<p>Directions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Combine sugar, cocoa, water, and salt in a saucepan. Heat until it’s turned into a nice chocolatey paste, scraping down the sides and making sure it’s not burning.</li>
  <li>Stir in milk and vanilla, and the heat to your desired temperature (I use an instant-read thermometer to make sure it’s at a nice 135ºF). Make sure the milk doesn’t boil. I don’t know why, but the Hershey’s recipe says to not do that.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
