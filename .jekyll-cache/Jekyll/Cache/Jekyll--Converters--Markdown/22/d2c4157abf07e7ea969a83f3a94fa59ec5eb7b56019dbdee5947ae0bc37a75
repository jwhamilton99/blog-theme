I"ñ<p>Yesterday was the last day for the Femto fundraiser, and I just made the donation. The total came out to $74.59, which I just rounded up to an even $75. You can see the day-by-day breakdown on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F96IpzNAYbhM9mVr5BX88gy8SGU34xcvXlBjJwejd_8/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>, and the donation confirmation <a href="https://twitter.com/femtoeditor/status/1273692015692328962">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you so much to everyone who participated.</p>
