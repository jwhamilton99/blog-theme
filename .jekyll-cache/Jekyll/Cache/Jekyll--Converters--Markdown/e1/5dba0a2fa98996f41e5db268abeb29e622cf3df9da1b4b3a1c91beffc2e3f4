I"Ý<p>I think everyone has at least some idea of the shit thatâ€™s happening in America right now, and it seriously pained me to just sit idly by while people were out there fighting against this oppression. I would attend a protest if I could, but sadly circumstances donâ€™t allow. Iâ€™m still trying to help in any way I can, which is why Iâ€™m doing another fundraiser.</p>

<p>From tomorrow, June 3rd, to June 17th, 100% of all proceeds from <a href="https://www.femtoeditor.com">Femto</a>, my text editor (and the only paid app I make), will be donated to organizations that fight against racism and police brutality. I learned about <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ab_mn">this ActBlue page</a> from Christian Selig, the developer of <a href="https://apolloapp.io/">Apollo</a>, who showed an incredible amount of his own generosity earlier today. You can learn more about this fundraiser on <a href="https://www.femtoeditor.com">femtoeditor.com</a>, and follow the running total for the next 2 weeks. Purchases from new users and tips from existing users will be counted toward this total.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your support, and please encourage your friends and loved ones to donate in any form. Stay safe out there.</p>
