I"Ž<p>If you visit my site, you may have noticed some color changes. For the entire duration of <a href="https://lgbt.wikia.org/wiki/Gay_and_Lesbian_Pride_Month">Pride Month</a>, this site will show the colors of various Pride flags (the full list is <a href="https://twitter.com/jwhamilton_/status/1264773859099770880">here</a>). If youâ€™re interested in the code side of this, you can see the script <a href="https://www.jwhamilton.co/scripts/pride.js">here</a>. I myself am bisexual, and I wear that proudly. I know this is a tiny way to celebrate on a site that gets little traffic, but this is my little corner of the Internet that I have full control over, and thatâ€™s honestly really comforting right now. And yes, I did wait until midnight today to post this. Iâ€™m excited.</p>

<p>So happy Pride Month to all the wonderful people who are out, in the closet, or figuring themselves out. Stay safe.</p>
